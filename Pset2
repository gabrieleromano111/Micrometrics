* Observing the graphs, one can notice a pattern of lower average levels of schooling in individuals born in the first quarter relative to the rest of the year, even though the data is not always consistent with the pattern and the pattern is not always salient. The relevance of the instrument is something that could and should be tested.

*Exogeneity would arguably not be plausible since both quarter of birth and health status are both correlated with age

*The exclusion restriction, on the other hand, appears to be plausible, as we believe that quarter of birth has no direct effect on health

*In the setting considered by the paper the independent variable is schooling, the dependent is earnings and quarter of birth is used as an instrument. We identify the following potential problems with the two assumptions
*EXOGENEITY - Again, quarter of birth is 'mechanically' correlated with age and one could argue that earnings are correlated with age too. The acknowledge this issue and consider men between 40 and 49, whose wages, as they argue and verify, are hardly related to age  
*EXCLUSION - It is arguably the case that the exclusion restriction is satisfied and that quarter of birth does not have a direct effect on earnings


*** c

* OLS estimates should be biased upward. 

* This is because of the correlation of both schooling and earnings to variables that affect them in the same direction, such as verbal and quantitative skills. Intuitively, there is a "selection into treatment", as the earnings of those who have completed more years of schooling in the counterfactual case of them completing less are arguably not comparable to the earnings of those who actually completed less. This is because those that completed less schooling also have lower levels of verbal and quantitative skills, so that their earnings are lower not only as a consequence of the fewer years of schooling. Analogously, the earnings of those who have more years of schooling are higher not only as a consequence of their additional schooling.

* Let D, Y, Z be a binary causal variable, an outcome and a binary instrument respectively. Compliers are defined as those for whom
* D(Z=0) = 0 and D(Z=1) = 1
* If the outcome considered is health, the causal variable is education, and the instrument is quarter of birth, the compliers would be those for whom quarter of birth has an effect on education. As argued in Angrist and Krueger (1991), this is true for individuals that leave school at the minimum legal age possible.

* We first summarize the variable 'Healthy' and then we store its mean as a scalar named 'mu_y'.

	scalar mu_y = r(mean)


* We now summarize the variable 'Education' and then we store its mean as a scalar named 'mu_x'.
	qui sum Education
	scalar mu_x = r(mean)



*** b

* We generate the dummy variables for each quarter of birth. In this case we are aware of the values contained in 'birthqtr', hence, we can take a more explicit approach than with 'region'.
	forvalues i = 1/4 				{
	
		gen Quarter`i' = (birthqtr==`i')
	
	}  

* We generate the dummy variables for each region. Since a priori we do not know the values contained in 'region', we implement a general procedure. In particular, we exploit the 'gen()' option of the 'tab' command.
	foreach var in region birthyear {
		
		qui tab `var', gen(`var'_)
		
	}


* Now, we create the two local variables using the 'unab' command, which allows us not to list all controls. Note: we are including all the dummy variables. Since the regressions will be run with the constant, in order to avoid perfect multicollinearity, Stata will automatically drop one dummy for each covariates set.

* We run the three IV regressions using Quarter1-Quarter3 as instrument and adding progressively more controls. We then store the estimates and save the F-statistic of the excluded instruments as a scalar. We take a conservative approach by computing robust standard errors.

	estimates store iv_1
	scalar F_first_1 = e(widstat)

* In point 2.e, we run three iv regressions of the variable "Healthy", using "Quarter1", "Quarter2" and "Quarter3" as instruments for "Education" and progressively expanding the set of controls. What these regressions show is that education has a positive and significant impact on health, even when controlling for date and place of birth and marital status. If we also consider the first stage regression of point 3.b, one can notice that dummies for quarter of birth have a negative and statistically significant impact on education. This is because individuals born earlier in the year receive on average less schooling than others, since they reach the legal dropout age earlier in their education path compared to students born in later quarters. 
*From the reduced-form regression, we see that being born in the first or second quarter of the year has a negative and significant impact on health outcomes, while that of the third quarter is not significant. Indeed, this is consistent with what preoviously observed. Since, as we have estimated, education has a positive impact on health outcomes, while being born in earlier quarter of the year has a negative impact on education, the reduced-form shows that being born in earlier quarters negatively (and significantly) impacts health outcomes and we can conclude that education is a channel for this process.

* [even though analyzing the R^2 we find a negative value, which however could occur in the regressions for a 2SLS. (da togliere se non siamo sicuri).]
*
*
* The two issues identified in Bound et al.(1995) related to the use of weak instruments are inconsistency and finite sample bias.
* As regards the first issue, if the instrument is weakly correlated with the endogenous variable but also slightly correlated with the error term, this could cause inconsistency of the IV estimator, greater than that of an OLS with endogenous variable.  In our specific context, if the quarters of birth were weak instruments for education level, inconsistency would be an issue if there were other channels through which quarter of birth may influence health other than educational level. As we remarked in part b of question 1, quarter of birth and health status are both correlated with age. This means that a correlation of the instrument with the outcome variable is more than plausible. Moreover, to make some examples, we refer to the literature Bound et. al (1995) cite to criticize Angrist and Krueger (1991), as we think it may be of relevance also in our setting. For example, they report evidence that quarter of birth is related to the likelihood that students show behavioural difficulties, suffer from psychological or mental issues, but also evidence that children from higher-income families are less likely to be born in winter. Thus we think that the factors presented may have impacts on health outcomes. If so, it could be that quarter of birth affects health through these other channels and not only through education. If these effects were strong enough, they may cast doubt on quarter of birth as an instrument for education, and might as well be a cause for inconsistency in the estimation of a model such as the one we are studying.

* The second issue, "finite-sample bias", occurs as the IV is biased in small samples, due to the fact that while executing the second stage regression, the estimates from first stage are used, instead of the true values of first stage parameters, which remain unknown. In this case, we reason on the presence of finite-sample bias analyzing the F-statistic for the first stage of the regression. The high value of the F-statistic (by far greater than the conventional threshold of ten) does not indicate that the instruments are weak. The F-test of significance of the instruments in the first stage rejects the null hypothesis.

* It's worth noting that all IV estimates are still biased in finite samples and that all samples are finite by definition.

* Both F-statistics are smaller than ten, the conventional critical level for testing the relevance of the instruments. Hence, the instruments used are weak. This will very likely entail severe bias in smaller samples. This issue would have to be considered for both regressions.
